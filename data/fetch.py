# QCEW fetcher: downloads quarterly county-level (and U.S. national) employment
# and wage data from BLS and caches it locally as parquet.
"""
Data comes from BLS's per-area QCEW CSV endpoint (BLS_BASE_URL), one
county-quarter file at a time. The files are combined into one DataFrame and
saved under data/cache/. Later loads read that cache instead of calling the
API, because QCEW updates quarterly with a 6-9 month lag, so there is no
reason to hit BLS on every app load. To pull new quarters, call refresh_data()
or delete the cache file.
